Using AMBA CHI or AXI protocols for cache coherency instead of snooping-based protocols like MOESI:
Scalability: Consider a large-scale multi-core system with hundreds or thousands of cores, such as those found in data centers or high-performance computing clusters. In such systems, the overhead and complexity of snooping-based protocols like MOESI can become prohibitive due to the sheer number of cores and the increased contention on the bus. AMBA CHI and AXI protocols, designed with scalability in mind, can efficiently manage cache coherence across a large number of cores without suffering from the scalability limitations of snooping-based protocols.

Reduced Bus Traffic: In a multi-core system where snooping-based protocols are used, every cache coherence transaction results in a broadcast message being sent to all cores on the bus. This can lead to high bus traffic and potential congestion, especially in large systems with numerous cores. In contrast, AMBA CHI and AXI protocols utilize point-to-point communication, where coherence messages are targeted specifically to the necessary cores, reducing overall bus traffic and minimizing the risk of congestion.

Lower Latency: Imagine a multi-core system deployed across geographically dispersed locations, such as in a distributed computing environment. In snooping-based protocols, caches must snoop every transaction on the bus to maintain coherence, which can introduce latency due to the time it takes for coherence messages to propagate across long distances. AMBA CHI and AXI protocols enable more efficient cache coherence mechanisms by directly communicating coherence information between caches without the need for bus snooping, thus reducing latency and improving system performance even in geographically dispersed scenarios.

Flexibility and Configurability: Consider a multi-core system with heterogeneous cache requirements, where different cores may have varying levels of cache hierarchy or cache coherency granularity. AMBA CHI and AXI protocols offer greater flexibility and configurability compared to snooping-based protocols, allowing designers to tailor coherence mechanisms to specific system requirements. For example, designers can customize cache coherence policies, cache line sizes, or coherence transaction types to optimize system performance based on the characteristics of the workload and the architecture of the system.

Support for Non-Inclusive Caches: In a multi-core system employing non-inclusive cache designs, data present in lower-level caches may not necessarily be duplicated in higher-level caches. This can lead to challenges in maintaining cache coherence, especially with snooping-based protocols that assume inclusive cache hierarchies. AMBA CHI and AXI protocols, however, can efficiently support non-inclusive cache architectures without sacrificing coherence, ensuring that data remains consistent across all levels of the cache hierarchy even in systems with complex cache designs.
